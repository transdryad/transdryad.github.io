  In 2022, more than 9.2% of the world's population, or 735 million people experienced chronic hunger,[^fn1] an alarming increase from 2019. 30-40% of food is wasted each year in the United States.[^fn2] There are 336.4 million people in the United States.[^fn3]
  
  If we take the number of calories the average citizen is meant to eat in a day, 2,000, and multiply it by the population of the US we get 672.8 billion calories per day. However, the US in total consumes about 815 billion calories per day,[^fn4], about 142.2 billion extra. 
  
  That's enough to feed 71.1 million more people or reduce world hunger by 0.9% if it were properly distributed. According to the UN, 2.5% of people in the United States, 8.4 million people, are undernourished.[^fn5] That means that people in the US redistributed just 2.5% of their total caloric intake each day, nearly everyone in the country would have enough food. 

  It was impossible to get an accurate number of the calories of food wasted each year, but just by looking at these numbers, if little to no food was wasted in the US, a great deal more of the world would be fed.

  This brings up the problem of distribution: how does the average person take that 2.5% of daily calories and send it to people who need it? Charities and food banks. 
  
  For those living in and around Boulder County, [Community Food Share](https://communityfoodshare.org/) is a good option. They have a massive distribution center in Louisville that currently provides 30,000 meals a day. For the wider US, donate to [Feeding America](https://www.feedingamerica.org/).
