  In 2022, more than 9.2% of the worlds population, or 735 million people experinced chronic hunger,[^fn1] an alarming increase from 2019. 30-40% of food is wasted each year in the United States.[^fn2] There are 336.4 million people in the United States.[^fn3]
  
  If we take the number of calories the average citizen is meant to eat in a day, 2,000, and multiply it by the population of the US we get 672.8 billion calories per day. However, the US in total consumes about 815 billion calories per day,[^fn4], about 142.2 billion extra. 
  
  That's enough to feed 71.1 million more people, or reduce world hunger by 0.9% if it were properly distributed. According to the UN, 2.5% of people in the United States, 8.4 million people, are undernourished.[^fn5] That means that people in the US redistrobuted just 2.5% of hteir total caloric intake each day, near everyone in the country would have enough food.
